# Saturday March 20, 2021
Agenda: 
Short meeting, 
Testing, 
Fix tokens, 
Restaurant Dashboard, 
Refactoring

## Notes
- First test for the address page is pushed to its own branch, look at comments to familiarize for when we need to start testing
- Found an error in the jwt_tools.decode, value passed is invalid when passing to cookies for the restaraunt menu, solution: It wants the user to be logged in when getting menu items for when a user clicks on a restaurant from search when not logged in, Michael has a fix for this
- Refactor the menu endpoints so that it doesn't require being logged in
- Block routes on the client side if we want to prevent not logged in orders
- Tokens are expiring and the front end doesnâ€™t check for an expired token before it sends causing an error, 20 minute lifespan
- The two endpoints are similar but just different enough, keep both for now
- The endpoint doesn't care if you don't have the token initialized, if its empty it just does nothing, but if it is present it will refresh it
- New endpoint for testing if a token is expired/invalid
- Restaurant dashboard page where all restaurant info can be put, the plan is for it to have tabs to cycle between employees, covid reports, menus, tags, orders, you can add your work to the page after page is completed
- We need to do some refactoring on the tags component and other components, we need to re-use component for the restaurant tag management, so good practice to do this for all components
