Agenda: 
Sprint 4, 
Refactoring, 
New Features, 
Styling, 
Project Wrap Up

## Notes
- Users can be logged in and still add items to their cart, but cart will show an error, redirect users to login when they try to add items to cart and aren't logged in
- Want a way to get most recent order, just need to reorganize ordering list
- Look into expire time for tokens, extend time, some endpoints don't refresh or return new tokens, so it will expire too early, add an "are you still there" feature
- Add order history for customer
- New feature idea: Mobile compatibility, two user stories, one for styling to look good on a phone, and one for making functionality mobile friendly
- Check for token errors
- Take out report route
- Fix enter address page so you don't to enter addres twice and so users who have an account can sign in on that page, for users that are logged in they only have to enter their address when they need it (for ordering) but for browsing they don't need one
- For menu, after adding an item we need a more obvious way to go to checkout, easiest solution would be to add a button to menu page
- Testing: do we need integration testing, we have two databases set up, one for testing, we run in to problems with conflicts in the database, we could flush database but it would be a lot of work to set up
- Need to enforce coding style, stuff like arrow functions, import statement, cases, fix css styling
- Refactor frontend directories and packages into similar functionality
- Some routing issues, with pages being accessible when they should not be
