# Wednesday March 3, 2021
Agenda: 
Sprint 2 Retrospective, 
Sprint 3 planning, 
Contact tracing, 
Payment Processing 

## Notes
**Retro:**

What went well:
- Sprint went smoothly, accomplished everything we wanted to
- Good communication
- Good team work

What we could improve:
- Make a dev task first, then make the branch with the name and number of dev task (ex. #100-branch-name)
- More help on the back end, don't want to put all the work on one person
- Add backend/frontend tags for dev tasks
- Finish tasks sooner, to make integration and refactoring easier

**Sprint 3 Planning:**
- What are we using for payment processing: Stripe, need to discuss security, storing credit cards leave for end of sprint 3 or maybe sprint 4 enhancements 
- Switch to Redux to manage state, using context to manage lots of state can get out of hand, Ezra is familiar with Redux and he can help us if we get stuck
- We will all need to take the time to learn Redux before we start
- For contact tracing system: add self reporting to restaurants and drivers, need form to fill that will include date picker using UNIX time stamp, then all orders within two weeks of date will notify any contacts, its a one way system
- Drivers: need location for order status, will pull drive time from restaurant to customer's address, will have a list of currently active orders, with current stage of order
- As well as fully implementing two remaining main features, implement any left over tasks
- Get list of fake cards from Stripe for testing purposes
- We will start to pick up more backend tasks and update the documentation
- Testing: try to do TDD for backend, aim to have one acceptance test for each user story, try to decide on one good test and one error test for each function, have integration testing for frontend and backend
- Aim to finish by 22nd, so that we can start creating the acceptance tests because we need to have to components before we can do that
- Need to get started on project before we meet again, maybe meet around Sunday or Monday
- Tahmidul, Ezra: payments
- James, Matt: contact tracing
