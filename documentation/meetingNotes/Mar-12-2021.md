Agenda: 
Payments, 
Orders, 
Contact Tracing, 
Menu, 
Restaurant Dashboard, 
Technique Seminar 

## Notes
- Menu for restaurants need to be done, need to add and remove items
- Payments, use Stripe they have a React component, can use that component in the frontend but if we need security we should go through the backend
- Order management for restaurants: need to wait until we've created valid transaction, need to address total for transaction, so in the case where menu item price changes then order total remains consistent with time of order
- Need to set up some dummy orders that we can pull from the backend for testing
- Payments will need to have multiple states to manage transactions, when and order is placed, Stripe can hold the transaction and then cancel it later, or we create our own state to manage accepted and cancelled transactions
- Employees from restaurant, need to be managed, can add and remove
- Form for restaurant user, date of positive test, send email to users in contact with those employees
- Restaurants should have their own dashboard and custom navigation, for displaying things like current orders, and employees management, need to make user story for that
- Restaurant account/staff management will have to be different as well
- Images for menu items: don't need to be real images
- Tag management, add and remove tags for restaurant searching, tags are attached to restaurants themselves
