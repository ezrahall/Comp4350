# Wednesday February 17, 2021
Agenda: 
Sprint 2 dev tasks, 
Design choices, 
UI frameworks, 
API functionality 

## Notes
- Talked about color schemes and layouts, decided between material UI or bootstrap
- Looked at navbar for color and functionality
- How will we do post requests for endpoints, monolithic style containing all relevant information
- Need to include address for restaurant search
- Menu for restaurants: need to have restaurant accounts set up to be able to add a menu
- Need to create a home page, right now users are pre-signed in
- Need to create endpoint for user information
- As we login, we can send all user info as well as success to save time
- Default restaurant search endpoint will return random restaurants for browsing
- Users will need their address, phone number, other info, but can be added later on and not during registration
- Who's doing what, we will need to create dev tasks so we know what we have left to do
- Tahmidul and Michael will talk later about styling, since their work is overlapping
- Michael will look into oauth for social media log in
- Decided restaurant login will be in same place as user login, maybe add a button to toggle
- We will have one endpoint for restuarant update, just makes it easier
- Talked about autocomplete API, JSON will be returned on each key-up, need to make sure we use the same token, to not repeatedly ping the Google API
- We will have another meeting around Sunday
