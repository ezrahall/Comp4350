# Monday April 5, 2021
Agenda: 
Sprint 4 wrap up, 
Presentation,
Outline

## Notes
- Acceptance tests were failing because of the way a button worked, but they are fixed now
- Mobile compatibility is going to be a big process for the whole website, try to make scaling look nice
- Coding style, everybody look over code and see if we need to change anything, in other words proof read your work
- **Presentation:** Architecture, Testing, Talk about things we cut, oauth/driver system
- Things we could have done better: plan more in advance, since no TDD we found problems at the time of testing, it would be better to do it in advance, what other technologies or frameworks could we have used to make things better/easier (Next.js)
- We can talk about time spent on features, talk about having trust in each other and getting our parts done
- We will have less speakers this time, so the flow of presentation is smoother
- Conclusion, what went right and what went wrong, what we would do if we could start over
- Hold another meeting on Wednesday, to talk about slides and who is presenting
- Talked about project release, look into static analysis tools for after sprint 4 is over
