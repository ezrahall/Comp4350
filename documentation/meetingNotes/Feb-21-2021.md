# Sunday February 21, 2021
Agenda: 
Sprint 2 progress, 
Architecture design choices, 
Login to Homepage flow

## Notes
- What should our homepage be, discussed how its easier if users have to be logged in. Once a user is logged in, they have to enter an address and from there they can see our homepage.
- What details will we need for restaurants, DB is set up to return images for resturant main pic only, but we will leave out ratings for this iteration
- Checkout feature doesn't need to be, functional for this iteration 
- We will store address in the client just for current session, users will have to re-enter address for new session
- Will be using useContext for session state
- Discussed potential security risks, no risks at this time
- Talked about UI for resturant registration and login, will put it in the same place as user login, just add toggle
- Talked about CI, automated tests already are running for backend, will need to add a new yml file for frontend tests
- Need to create dev tasks for everything, pull requests or branches will need to reference issue number
- Ezra will work on UI for searching for restaurant, Michael will keep working on account login, James will start building the Enter Address page 
- Tags for search for will be stored in the frontend, will add to request under tag to refine search
- Search only returns restaurants, even when search is for menu items and even when tags are included
- Next meeting Wednesday at 2:00 pm
