Agenda: Proposal wrap up, 
Team evaluation, 
Sprint 2 task organization, 

## Notes
- Discussed adding acceptance criteria to user stories
- Went through our team evaluations and decided where to give out our points, came to an agreement about which teams get which points
- Will we add stakeholders to the project summary/vision 
- Will make sure our project description lines up with the description we have in our readme
- What features do we want to do first and talked about if there is any technical challenges stopping us 
- For account management feature: need to make sure we finish drivers/customers/restaurant, do it in a modular reusable way
- Goal for sprint 2: account management, browsing restaurants will have high priority, other two features will have medium and low priorities
- Talked about how we want to design the endpoints for search, individual endpoints or more monolithic, will need to figure this out later on as we start developing
- Discussed how to or if we need to paginate requests, aim for about 30 restaurants to begin
- Start the sprint by creating dev tasks for each user story
- We will have to figure out how to set up the Github CI 
- Need to give every team member full admin access to the Github repository
Summary:
- Michael will add stakeholders
- We will each add our acceptance criteria to our user stories
- Ezra will submit proposal when weâ€™re done
- Ezra and Matt will setup frontend and backend respectively
- We will all start creating dev tasks
